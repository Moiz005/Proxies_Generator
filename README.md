Proxy Scraper & Validator
This project is a web scraper designed to extract HTTP proxies from FreeProxyWorld. The scraped proxies are initially stored in a CSV file. After collection, the proxies undergo a validation process, where only the functional ones are filtered and saved in a separate file.

This ensures that only active and reliable proxies are retained for further use.
